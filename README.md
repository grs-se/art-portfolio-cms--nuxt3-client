## Project Overview

I am a self-taught entry level software developer with a range of transferable skills. I began learning to code just before “lockdown”, whilst working full-time in Landscape Construction. My motivation was to build an art portfolio website linked to a database that a user could interact with in many ways: sorting, filtering, different viewing modes, commenting, bookmarking, etc. However, I quickly became fascinated with programming and this project became more ambitious, a training ground to learn more advanced programming concepts: state-management, universal and client-side rendering, cloud asset management, authentication and authorization, etc. These days I program more than making art!

This project is currently in a simple form as a public display portfolio, but I am in the process of implementing additional functionality to upgrade the project to include the following functionality:

- CMS, to enable artist's to manage and archive all of their artworks
- An artist's educational e-resource book - to compile inspiration resources;
- A review and critiquing platform for mentors and fellow artist's to interact with each other and the artworks, and provide feedback.

A 'Universal' rendered application built with Vue.js(3), Nuxt(3), Pinia. Source code for the accompaying backend project - a custom REST API server - can be found at: https://github.com/grs-se/art-portfolio-cms--api-server

Please note: this project is still in development, contains faults and unfinished implementation, and is not ready for production use.
